        <p>I often think about what led me to this career path, and I feel like I am able to boil it down to a few
            pivotal moments and a few jobs throughout my life. Though coding is something I couldn't see myself learning
            before this chain of events. I've come to really enjoy it. &#58 &sup;</p>
        <p>My professional journey started at a company called Kiddie Kollege, a daycare that my mother ran as the
            director when I was a sophopmore in highschool. I started as an assistant teacher, role in which I would
            assist the primary teacher with their classroom. My jobs ranged from aiding along with lessons to custodial
            work for the school-age class. Eventually I was promoted to an assistant director role and put in charge of
            bookeeping through microsoft excel when it was eventually introduced to our bookeeping processed. This was
            the first time I was put in charge of a technological process, it sparked my curiosity.<br><br>

        </p>
        <p>Another important stop along on the journey was when I participated the K-12 inititive and the various
            programs STEM focused programs that they continue to provide until this day for inner-city youth. They even
            eventually hired me along with many of my peers to aid in facilitating the curriculum. I was given the title
            of Technology lead where I learned how to fix minor computer issues, most often resolved when restarting the
            computer. I bet all of this sounds like I am eventually going to say, these moments are what led me to
            coding but they aren't and we are just scratching the surface. I went to UMKC where I studied Psychology,
            because I have always had a vauge interest in Psychology as a concepts and the many theories from geniuses
            like Carl Jung and Mary Ainsworth. After graduating I became a case worker Paces and quickly learned to make
            any actual money in Psychology I would have to get a lot more education than I currently had and go into an
            exorborant amount of debt. I quickly realized that theories do not pay the bills. So I wanted to try my hand
            at something different. </p>
        <p>I actually ended up trying to do something as different as possible. I took a class where I became a business
            travel agent for BCD Travel. This was the first time that I used a command line, unbeknownst to me of
            course. The command line is the most important part of Saber, a legacy software that is ubiquitous
            throughout the travel industry. Then the most pivotal thing to happen in my software developmemnt journey
            with the pandemic. I ended up meeting a friend who worked as a Software Developer, who floated the idea that
            I had what it took to learn how to code. I also lost my job with BCD Travel due to the pandemic completly
            stopping travel. I worked a few different jobs to get by. I delivered pizza, sold insurance and spent some
            time at a call center while looking for what I wanted to do next professionally.
            Then I was introduced to Freecodecamp by my software developer friend, who told me to complete HTML and CSS
            modules and if I liked it well enough I should try out JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Self-studying and working through HTML and CSS was wonderful. But I soon found out that this was only the
            honeymoon phase. I worked through so many different online courses and watched so many Javascript tutorials.
            It often felt like I was just staring at a screen mindlessly, my friend suggested that I look into taking a
            code bootcamp. In my reasearch I ran accross LaunchCode and really became entralled by the mission. I
            applied 2022 but I did not get in. I told myself I would study JavaScript and apply the next time it became
            availible. My skills improved slow and steadily and the dread that I once had for sitting infront of the
            computer started to go away. I also ended up getting my job at BCD travel back and also ended up getting
            accepted into LaunchCode so I said why not both? </p>

        <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I was not sure if I would have the energy to study after work but I have been
            infected with the coding bug, that pun was very much so inteded. LaunchCode has helped me fill in a lot of
            the gaps that I had in from my days of self-study. The journey is still currently en route but I am enjoying
            it line by line.</p>
